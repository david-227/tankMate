# tankMate
__tankMate is aiming to create an all-in-one solution to managing and monitoring aquariums/tanks using an opensource, customizable tool.__


## Functions
__The goal with tankMate is to ensure that the monitoring and managment of reptile and fish tanks will be streamlined through a single, web application that can be customized to fit the users needs.__
Features we are aiming to have in tankMate:

### Tank Info:
* Tank ID (Nickname/ID Number)
* Tank Type (Aquatic / Semi Aquatic / Terrestrial etc.)
* Tank Size
* Filter Type
* Light Type
* Other Equipment (Skimmer, UV Filter, Air Pump etc.)
* Substrate Type (Gravel, Sand, Stratum etc.)

### Livestock:
* Species
* Age
* Where purchased
* When purchased
* Last feeding

### Plants:
* Species
* Fertilizer Types (If applicable)
* Fertilizing Regiment (If applicable)
* Trimming

### Maintenance
* Last water change (Tank or water dish)
* Last cleaning
* Humidity (if applicable)
* Temperature
* Chemistry (PH, Nitrate, Hardness etc.) (If applicable)
* Special maintenance

Once the initial version of tankMate has been made available, users will be able to edit and update the software to fit specific needs. Sensors, automated water changes, even camera monitoring are all ideas that have floated around the project so far.

## Timeline?

Currently there is no release timeline for tankMate. While the project is being developed and planned. It is being done so as a hobby and self-test during the process of learning to program in Javascript and other languages.
